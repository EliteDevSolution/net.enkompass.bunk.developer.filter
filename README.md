# The Bunk Developer Filter Project
This is a blank project and meant to be the starting point for the bunk developer filter project.  If you are reading this, chances are that you are one of a handful of freelance developers that we will consider hiring on a regular basis. We are looking to seeing your pull requests here very soon.

## Guidelines
Your app should be made with one of the following (listed in order of [our] preference):
- Serverless Framework
- Meteor
- Node
- JavaScript

We are going to be looking at your code style, your efficiency, your knowledge, and your overall capacity to kick ass.

## Requirements
- Show you are a master of SSO by having your app log the user into any public cloud app of your choosing.
- Let us know you know how to build interfaces with Vue or React. No need for anything fancy although you certainly can.
- Display your mastery of the craft with your clean coding style.
- Demonstrate your mastery of the basic devloper workflow employed by many projects around the web. 

## Extra Credit
You will get massive bonus points for implementing one or all of the following in your branch:
- Sending a pull request from CodeCommit.
- Using Cloud9 to develop your app (see the item about video below).
- Including a CloudFormation template to deploy your entire application to AWS without manual intervention (other than to collect parameters at launch).
- If you think writing CloudFormation templates sucks balls, we will also accept Ansible playbooks.
- Including a shortcut document to a YouTube video showing us how quickly you completed this project (time lapse video from start to finish would be great).
- If you did NOT choose the Serverless Framework to build your app with, call a Lambda function using the API Gateway...to do anything you want. 
- Documentation.  If you know, you know.  You know?

Best of luck!
